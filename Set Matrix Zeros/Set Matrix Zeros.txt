question link:
https://www.codingninjas.com/codestudio/problems/set-matrix-zeros_3846774?topList=striver-sde-sheet-problems&leftPanelTab=0

Now how to solve that question without taking any space
approach:
first find the zero element in the matrix then mark the 0 in the 0th row and column
after marking all zero element search for those marking and make whole row amd column to zero

time complexity is O(n)
space complexity is O(1)
