Approach:

we use array indices to store the visited state of each number. We know that only the dulicate element
would be visited more than once.For each nuber we go to its index position and checking whether it less than
zero arr[index]<0 if yes we revited there it means its a dublicate element else we make it negative by multiplying
-1 by the number.

Explanation: 

Traverse from start and get index by abs(i) -1 then check its value is negative if yes return, otherwise
multiply by -1 for mark the number to be visited

2 4 1 5 3 6 8 7 4

-2 -4 -1 -5 -3 -6 -8 -7 4

-4 is negative hence it revisted there it means its a dublicate element

Output: 

4
