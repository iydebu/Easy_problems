Approach
----------------------------------------------------------------
We can exploit the property that we will only haves 0s,1sand 2s in our array.

-> Count the frequency of 0s and 1s and 2s present in the array
-> Start from i=0 and first fill the number of 0s present in the array
->then fill the number of 1s present in the array
->then fill the number of 2s present in the array
-> Finally we have a sorted array of 0s, 1sand 2s
