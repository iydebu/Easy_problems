Approach:
The idea is to use the definition of the pascals triangle that its cofficient
and are summation of adjacent is preceding rows. so in this way we can store 
the elements in a matrix and for futher generation of values in it we can check
the preceding elemnts and updat the values.

-> Declare an ArrayList of array list PASCALS to store the elements values
-> Run a loop from row i =0 till n-1
-> Now inside this loop run one more loop from j=0 till j<=i
-> if the number is first or last one then just store 1 in the matrix i.e pascals[i][j] = 1;
-> else store the sum of adjecent elemnts in preceding rows i.e pascals[i][j] = pascals[i-1][j-1]+pascal[i-1][j]
-> Print this value i.e the value in the current iteration pascal[i][j]

Time complexity : O(n^2)
Space complexity : O(n)
